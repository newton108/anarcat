hardlink is a tool which replaces multiple copies of a file with hardlinks.
Inspiration came from <http://code.google.com/p/hardlinkpy/>, but no code has
been used.

I started from scratch because hardlinkpy lacks a consistent style and does
not conform to PEP 8. Furthermore, it supports Python 1.5, which means no
new functionality is used.

My program requires at least Python 2.5, passes all known python checking
tools (pylint,pychecker,pyflakes) without errors/warnings/information, and is
compatible with Python 3.0 (after using 2to3).

Downloads
------------
* [[hardlink_0.1.1.tar.gz]] - The tarball
* [[hardlink_0.1.1_all.deb]] - official Debian package (requires Debian Lenny|Ubuntu Feisty)
* [hardlink 0.1.1~bpo40+1 all.deb](hardlink_0.1.1~bpo40+1_all.deb) - unofficial Debian package (requires Debian 4.0)

The tarball can be regenerated at any time by running "pristine-tar checkout
hardlink_0.1.1.tar.gz" from inside a clone of the git repository.

Installation
------------
To install hardlink into /usr, run make install.

 * DESTDIR - May be set to another root system (useful for packaging)
 * PREFIX  - Normally usr, may be changed to usr/local
 * MANDIR  - Normally $(PREFIX)/share/man (some systems may use $(PREFIX)/man)
 * BINDIR  - Normally $(PREFIX)/bin

Differences to hardlinkpy
-------------------------
For users of hardlinkpy, several things are different. One of the most
important changes is the renaming of all --foo-ignore arguments to
--ignore-foo ones. This is more similar to the naming of options in GNU
programs.

* --timestamp-ignore has been renamed to --ignore-time
* --owner-ignore has been renamed to --ignore-owner
* --rights-ignore has been renamed to --ignore-mode
* --filenames-equal has been renamed to --respect-name

The option --reverse has been renamed to --minimize. The option --max has
been renamed to --maximize.

At the moment, output is different. This may change at a later point.
